# T.N.T.

T.N.T. (Toil 'n Trouble) is a D&D 5e character sheet application. Please do not use it to commit crimes.

## Overview

FIXME: Write a paragraph about the library/project and highlight its goals.


## Setup

Install all dependencies

    lein install
    npm install

Run the back-end server

    lein do clean, run

Run the front-end server

    lein figwheel

Figwheel should automatically open default browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.
